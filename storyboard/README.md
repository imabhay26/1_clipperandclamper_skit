<p><strong>2.7 Equations/formulas:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>For clipper</em></strong></p>
<p>For Si diode V<sub>D</sub>=0.7V, V<sub>O</sub>=4V, V<sub>I</sub>=5 V (as given in aim)</p>
<p>Where: V<sub>D</sub>=Cut in voltage of the diode</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;V<sub>o</sub>=output voltage</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;V<sub>I</sub>=input voltage</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;V=Battery voltage</p>
<p>Apply Kirchoff&rsquo;s voltage law to get the equation</p>
<p>V<sub>0</sub>-V<sub>D</sub>-V=0 and solve it.</p>
<p><strong><em>For clamper</em></strong></p>
<p>Input voltage: 10 Volt peak to peak or 5 sin 2&pi;t</p>
<p>Required output voltage: 2 V (peak) to -8V (peak)</p>
<p>Apply the KVL in Circuit:</p>
<p>V<sub>in</sub>-V<sub>c</sub>-V<sub>1</sub>=0</p>
<p>The maximum voltage is V<sub>m</sub> then equation is</p>
<p>&nbsp;V<sub>m</sub>-V<sub>c</sub>-V<sub>1</sub>=0</p>
<p>Apply the KVL in output circuit</p>
<p>V<sub>in</sub>-V<sub>c</sub>-V<sub>o</sub>=0</p>
<p>Put equation (1) to equation(2)</p>
<p>V<sub>in</sub>-V<sub>m</sub>+V<sub>1</sub>=V<sub>o</sub></p>
<p>If V<sub>in</sub>=0 then V<sub>o</sub>=-V<sub>m</sub>+V<sub>1</sub></p>
<p>If V<sub>in</sub>= V<sub>m</sub> then V<sub>o</sub>=V<sub>1</sub></p>
<p>If V<sub>in</sub>=-V<sub>m</sub> then V<sub>o</sub>=-2V<sub>m</sub>+V<sub>1</sub></p>
<p>Now calculate the required parameters accordingly.</p>
